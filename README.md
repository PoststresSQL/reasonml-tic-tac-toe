# Tic-Tac-Toe ReasonML

This is a practice project to get me into ReasonML. The tic-tac-toe project i'll be building can be found at [Learn ReasonML by building Tic Tac Toe in React](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-reasonml-by-building-tic-tac-toe-in-react-334203dd513c) by [David Kopal](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@codinglawyer). 

## What I've learned:
- ReasonML is the OCaml language that mimics some JS syntax because of JS popularity in Web Development
- ReasonML is written in OCaml and compiled into JS through BuckleScript compiler
- ReasonReact follows React's core principles &emdash; Immutability, Functional Programming, and Type System &emdash; better than JS does.
- ReasonReact creates components through "Records" which are similar to JS Objects but are immutable.
